# MQTTNow

## Overview

An implementation of the ESP-Now protocol in combination with MQTT.

The idea is to use this protocol for several IOT devices in my smart home setup.
One node will be the bridge to my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) using MQTT. All others communicate to
this bridge using ESP-Now.
The advantage is that there is only one node connected to my WiFi network, reducing used IP addresses and workload for
router and Access points.

Since I use all different kinds of hardware for my devices (different kinds of ESP32/ESP8266 boards), the code has to
be so portable as possible.
Different build definitions are included in the platformio*.ini files.

The following borads have been defined:

| Board            | Environment             | Chip     | Controller         | MQTTClient/Webint  |
|------------------|-------------------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| ESP-01 512K      | esp01_512k              | ESP 8266 |                    |                    |
| ESP-01 512K      | esp01_512k_client       | ESP 8266 |                    | :heavy_check_mark: |
| ESP-01 1MB       | esp01_1m                | ESP 8266 |                    |                    |
| ESP-01 1MB       | esp01_1m_client         | ESP 8266 |                    | :heavy_check_mark: |

## Topology

A network consists of several nodes, from which one has the role of [controller](#controller).

The non-controller nodes (aka [slaves](#slave)) communicate with the controller using the esp-now protocol. They report
their status and listen for commands. They can also report events.

The controller is responsible for communication to the outside world over standard WiFi. Therefore the controller must
be connected to an accesspoint or router connected to the home network and maybe the internet. The controller normally
is also playing a slave role.

Which device is the controller doesn't matter, since there is no hardware difference. All nodes are ESP32/ESP8266 based,
and therefore they are all capable of communicating with a wireless network. The controller role is dynamically assigned
(see [Controller selection](#controller-selection)) among the available nodes, and as soon the node player the
controller role is offline, a new controller is chosen.

### Network ID

### Node category

There are several node categories. These categories describe in a nutshell what a node can and or does. They are based
on the device types as defined in the [Home Assistant MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery)
documentation. This category can then be used by third party software to determine how to categorize the new node.

Available categories are:

- alarmControlPanel (*)
- binarySensor (*)
- button (*)
- camera (*)
- cover (*)
- deviceTracker (*)
- deviceTrigger (*)
- fan (*)
- humidifier (*)
- hvac (*)
- light (*)
- lock (*)
- number (*)
- scene (*)
- select (*)
- sensor (*)
- siren (*)
- switch (*)
- tagScanner (*)
- vacuum (*)

## Slave

When a slave is turned on, it will send an [introduction message](#introduction-message) to the broadcast (MAC)address
`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`. The introduction message contains the MAC address of the slave and name for easy recognition. It
also contains a unique ID of the network it wants to connect to. For now this ID is hard coded, so it will have to be
included at compile time for all nodes intended for the same network.  
The running controller will check the network ID, and if it matches its own network id it will respond with a [welcome
message](#welcome-message) containing its mac address and register the slave as new node. The slave now knows who the
controller is and will from now on address all communication to the controller directly using its MAC address.  
If there is no response from a running controller node, the new node will take on the role of controller (see
[Controller initialization](#controller-initialization)) by connecting to the wifi network and wait for other nodes to
come online as slaves.

The slave can be anything from a simple lightbulb switch, a complete weatherstation, smart plug or anything else you
have in your smart-home.

## Controller

The controller is the central accesspoint to the whole MQTTNow network. Together with the [MQTT client](#mqtt-client)
it acts as a gateway between the MQTTNow network and the home wifi, so that you can access these nodes with normal wifi
enabled devices like a smartphone, computer or smart-home central like [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/) or [Home
Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io).

Using this WiFi connection the controller will also connect if available to an [MQTT broker](#mqtt) for mqtt
communication.

### Dedicated controller

### MQTT client

### Serial protocol

## Protocol

The protocol used for communication between the nodes is based on
[esp-now](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/software/esp-now/overview). A low-power communication protocol using the
same 2.4 Ghz radio that is used for wifi, but without the need for a central router. The nodes can communicate with
eachother peer-to-peer.  
Since the nodes are not connected to the home network, there is no way to access them directly. Therefore the controller
connects to the MQTTNow network, as well as to the home WiFi network and acts as a gateway.  
This way, only one IP address on the home network is needed for the whole esp=now network. For the outside world
(everything not in the MQTTNow network) the network is available as one device.

### Controller selection

When a node is turned on, and there is no controller present (eg, there is no [welcome message](#welcome-message) as a
response to the [introduction message](#introduction-message)), this node shall become the controller. This is the most
simple and mmost common scenario.

### Controller initialization

## MQTT

The MQTT communication with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) (or any other application communicating with
this network) goes over a couple of topics. These topics are subtopics of one [root topic](#root-topic).

    Root -+- \CMD -+-
          |        |--- node1
          |        |--- node2
          |
          |--- \stat -+--- \LWT
          |           |--- \state
          |           |--- node1 -+--- \LWT
          |           |           |--- \state
          |           |--- node2 -+--- \LWT
          |                       |--- \state
          |
          |--- \discovery -+-
                           |--- node1
                           |--- node2

All topics should have the `Retained` flag set to make sure a node can return to the last known correct state after
reconnect or power cycle.

### Root topic

The root topic is where all other communication is organized. The root topic itself contains no payload, only subtopics.
General subtopics are a [command](#command-topic) topic and a [status](#status-topic) topic.
`LWT`  information is contained in the status topic, and shows wether or not the whole network is online. In other
words, if the controller is connected to the MQTT broker. It can be either `online` or `offline`.
A third mandatory (sub)topic is the [Discovery topic](#discovery-topic). This topic holds all information needed for any
client to identify all nodes and their abilities. It can also be used to add a node to a client automatically if it
joins an MQTTNow network.

### Discovery topic

`\discovery`

The discovery topic can be used to automatically add nodes to 3rd party controlling software like
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io). Since the main idea of this project is to create a new protocol to be
used by Home Assistant please refer to [HASS MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery) for the
exact registration payload. This (sub)topic can be configured without the prepending slash (/). This is usefull if the
client has his own discovery topic, like Home Asisstant. In that case the discovery topic should be configured like
`homeassistant`.

### Command topic

`\CMD`

The command topic can be used to send commands to the network as a whole. This can be something like ... This is
typically set by 3rd party software.  
This topic also contains a subtopic for each node, identified by the node-id (see
[Node Command Topic](#node-command-topic)).  
The controller subscribes to this topic to receive commands for either the whole network or for a specific node.

### Status topic

`\stat`

The Status topic is used by the controller to publish network status. It shows its online status in the `\LWT` subtopic
and other information like controller name, network status information, IP address etc. For each node (and meaybe even
for the controller itself if it also has a node role) there is a [subtopic](#node-status-topic) containing status
information for that node.

### Node Command topic

`\CMD\<node-id>`

Any device that wants to control a specific node, can publish a message to the node command topic. The full topic will
be `root-topic\CMD\<node-id>`. What these commands can be is made available by the node.

### Node Status topic

`\stat\<node-id>`

The node status topic is used as feedback to the controller. The controller can see if the last command was successfully
executed. Also, because it has the 'retained' flag set, the node can check what the last know status was in case of a
powercycle or reconnect and go back to that state.

## Messages

ESP-Now supports messages with a maximum payload of 250 bytes. Therefore we have to be very careful with default meta
data to make sure enough room is left for actual data. The only default metadata send with each message is the message
type. Initial plan was to use a four character code to make it human readable, but that is replaced with a single one
byte (`int8`) code. The Four character code is used as enumeration in the code.  
All `char[x]` fields **may** be shortened using a NULL termination. If no NULL byte occurs, the full length is used.

### Introduction message

(`intr - 1`)

The Introdction message is send when a node is powered up. It kinda says "Hello everybody. My name is John, this is
what I do and who is the boss?". The message contains the following data:

| name | type | data | description |
|-|-|-|-|
| Message type | int8 | 1 | Code for messagetype |
| MAC address | byte[6] | A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6 | MAC address if this node |
| Network UUID | byte[16] | 3d0bb7a9-f3e3-4fa5-86b7-b5f0aeca41ad | See [Network ID](#network-id) |
| Category | int8 | 1 | See [Node category](#node-category) |
| Friendly name | char[30] | "light livingroom" | Descriptive name |

    |-|------|---~~~---|--|-----~~~-----|
     0  1-7    8-33     34   35-65 
    (total 66 bytes)

### Welcome message

(`welc - 2`)

The Welcome message is the response of the controller to an [Introcuction message](#introduction-message). Is basically
says "Hi John, welcome. I'll write you down as a new member if this network, and from now on you only talk to me."

| name | type | data | description |
|-|-|-|-|
| Message type | int8 | 2 | Code for messagetype |
| MAC address | byte[6] | A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6 | Mac address of the controller |

     t
     y        
     p        
     e  MAC   
    |-|------|
     0  1-7   
    (total 8 bytes)

### Request config message

(`rqcf - 3`)

When a new node has become a member of a network (eg, the controller has responded to the
[Introduction Message](#introduction-message) with a [Welcome message](#welcome-message)), the node can ask for
configuration data. This data is needed if this node wants to be a backup controller node (see
[Controller Selection](#controller-selection)) in case the current controller goes down or loses wifi connectivity.

| name | type | data | description |
|-|-|-|-|
| Message type | int8 | 3 | Code for messagetype |

     t
     y        
     p        
     e  
    |-|
     0 
    (total 1 byte)

### Configuration message

(`cnfg - 4`)

The response to the [Request Config Message](#request-config-message). This message contains all data that is needed to
take over the role of controller. Being wifi and mqtt credentials.

| name | type | data | description |
|-|-|-|-|
| Message type | int8 | 4 | Code for messagetype |
| WiFi SSID | char[32] | My-wifi | SSID of your network |
