## Slave

When a slave is turned on, it will send an [introduction message](protocol.md#introduction-message) to the broadcast (MAC)address `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`. The introduction message contains the MAC address of the slave and name for easy recognition. It also contains a unique ID of the network it wants to connect to. For now this ID is hard coded, so it will have to be included at compile time for all nodes intended for the same network. The running controller will check the network ID, and if it matches its own network id it will respond with a [welcome message](protocol.md#welcome-message) containing its mac address and register the slave as new node. The slave now knows who the controller is and will from now on address all communication to the controller directly using its MAC address. If there is no response from a running controller node, the new node will take on the role of controller (see [Controller initialization](protocol.md#controller-initialization)) by connecting to the wifi network and wait for other nodes to come online as slaves.

The slave can be anything from a simple lightbulb switch, a complete weatherstation, smart plug or anything else you have in your smart-home. It will listen to esp-now messages and/or send messages.
